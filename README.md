# Windows-Exfil-BadUsb üíªüîå

Welcome to **Windows-Exfil-BadUsb**! This repository contains a set of two PowerShell scripts that help gather sensitive data from a Windows machine and exfiltrate it to a Discord Webhook. The first script collects system information and sensitive files, while the second script uploads the collected data to a Discord channel for easy access. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö®

## üìÅ Scripts

### 1. **EXFIL.txt**
This script collects a variety of system information and stores it in a `results.txt` file. The data includes:
- **System Information** üñ•Ô∏è
- **Local Users** üë§
- **Network Profiles and Passwords** üåê
- **Installed Hotfixes** üîß
- **Environment Variables** üåç
- **Running Services** ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Active IPv4 Addresses** üåê
- **Exfiltrated Files** üìÇ

After running this script, you'll have a `results.txt` file that contains valuable system data.

### 2. **send_file.txt**
Once the `results.txt` is generated, this script uploads the file to a Discord Webhook using multipart form data. After the file is uploaded, it deletes the local copy to ensure no traces are left behind. ‚úâÔ∏èüì§
